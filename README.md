<h1>AutoTyper - Realistic Typing Simulation Tool</h1>

AutoTyper is a sophisticated typing simulation tool developed in Python, designed to emulate human-like typing patterns. With the integration of advanced modules such as [**customtkinter**](https://pypi.org/project/customtkinter/0.3/) for a user-friendly GUI and [**pyautogui**](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for simulating typing patterns, AutoTyper is a versatile solution for various applications requiring automated yet realistic text entry.

<h2>Features</h2>

**Realistic Typing Simulation:** AutoTyper leverages random number generation to introduce variability, imitating human typing speed and pauses, resulting in authentic typing patterns.    

**Human Typing Mode:** This mode adds an extra layer of realism by introducing natural irregularities found in human typing.

**Customizable User Interface:** Built with **customtkinter**, AutoTyper offers a sleek and modern interface, complete with text entry area and interactive controls for starting and stopping typing simulations.  

**Variable Speeds:** Users can adjust the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) using an interactive slider, catering to different scenarios and needs.    

**Easy-to-Use:** With a simple and intuitive design, AutoTyper requires minimal setup. Just launch the application, adjust settings, and start the simulation.
